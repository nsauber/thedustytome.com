My name is Nate Sauber. I'm a software engineer living in Cleveland, Ohio. I currently work at [OverDrive](http://overdrive.com) helping make digital books available for free to library patrons around the world.

Most of my career has been in .NET, though I'm interested in a variety of technologies. While I enjoy building greenfield solutions, I often find it more rewarding to take something that's broken and make it better. I'm fascinated by the code rot that can be found in "vintage" code-bases, and the infrastructure rot that tends to take hold in companies over time.

I work in tech, but at the end of the day what I really care about are people. I'm not interested in working a job where the company or the bottom line are consistently put above the individuals around you or the people your company serves. After all, if we can't [be excellent to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_yJFLvmjJY), what's the point?

Outside of tech, I enjoy the occasional video game and tabletop board game. I'm a bit of a film and television nerd, and I always have a couple of books which I'm in the middle of (usually a sci-fi or fantasy novel, and something tech-related). I've been accused of being an intellectual, which my interest in philosophy and support for the [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) do little to disprove.

If you're familiar with Myers Briggs personality theory, I'm an [INTJ][INTJ]... though I've picked up enough obnoxious habits that some might mistake me for an E. And after more than a decade married to an intelligent and self-aware ENFJ, I've <del>been bludgeoned to death with</del> come to value the importance of emotional intelligence.

I'm also a fierce advocate for Cleveland. The city [doesn't][cle-video1] [deserve][cle-video2] the reputation that it did 20 years ago. Yeah it's stupid-cold here and our sports teams can never catch a break. But we've got a [world-renowned orchestra][clevelandorchestra], a [top-of-it's-class hospital system][clevelandclinic], the [second-largest theatre complex in the United States][playhousesquare], and a [public market][westsidemarket] that puts Seattle to shame. We [rock][rockhall], we [dance][inletdance], and we give a crap about each other. We've got a unique mixture of blue-collar history and respect for the cultured things in life. It's exciting to watch the city re-invent itself. We're no longer a rust-belt relic, though still we know how to [laugh at ourselves][cle-badvideo].

This blog doesn't get updated terribly often. If you're itching for more, feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nsauber). I'm more active over there, sharing articles and other things that I find interesting.
