Like most programmers, I often put on music to help me "get in the zone". Sometimes this just means ignoring the chatter from my teammates (sorry all), but often the music can be an aid to keep my mind active and focused.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, most of the music I enjoy listening to outside of work isn't conducive to this state of mind. I'll get caught up in a particularly catchy hook, or start paying attention to the lyrics. The things I things I enjoy about a good song (being musically catchy or lyrically thoughtful) are just plain distracting when trying to stay focused.&nbsp;I've come across a few options that have worked well, and thought I'd share.<br />

For those of you with a few spare dollars in your pocket, the following are good options:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Brian Eno - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ambient-1-Music-For-Airports/dp/B000TERDJS/ref=tmm_msc_title_0" target="_blank">Ambient 1: Music for Airports</a>&nbsp;is a classic, though it's pretty short at 49 minutes.</li>
<li>Stars of the Lid - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refinement-Decline-Stars-Lid/dp/B000NIIUX8" target="_blank">and their Refinement of the Decline</a>&nbsp;is a pretty new find, but has about 2 hours of focus-friendly tracks.</li>
<li>Philip Glass - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Symphony-No-Music-Voyage-Civil/dp/B00122OCG8/ref=tmm_msc_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328835680&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Symphony No. 3</a> stands out, but many of his works are great here.</li>
<li>Sigur Ros - Pretty much anything, but I particularly appreciate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sigur-R%C3%B3s/dp/B00006LLNU/ref=pd_sim_m_5" target="_blank">()</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Takk-Sigur-Ros/dp/B000AJJNPY/ref=pd_sim_m_6" target="_blank">Takk</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Med-Sud-Eyrum-Spilum-Endalaust/dp/B001ACY8D2/ref=pd_sim_m_4" target="_blank">Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://musicforprogramming.net/" target="_blank">musicForProgramming();</a> - This is a newer find, which to date contains four+ hour mixes.</li>
<li><a href="http://comtruise.com/kc/" target="_blank">Komputer Casts</a> - Currently offers six mixes from one of the contributors to musicForProgramming();.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tranceportal.org/tranceportal/Podcast/Podcast.html" target="_blank">Trance Tuesday</a> - Not my first go-to anymore, but it has a huge archive of mixes.</li>
