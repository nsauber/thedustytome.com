I prefer the Deluge bit-torrent client over Ubuntu's default of Transmission, but it's always been a minor annoyance that Deluge's icon in the notification area didn't match the mono-chromatic icons of Ubuntu's excellent Ambiance theme. Fortunately, numbfall over at deviantart has [created a set of deluge icons](http://numbfall.deviantart.com/art/Deluge-ubuntu-mono-dark-Icons-183740859) to compliment this theme.

His instructions are pretty clear, so enjoy!
