After mucking around with <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> for about half an hour, I remembered that by default, Ubuntu doesn't include support for "non-free" codecs like mp3 or dvd playback.  You have to install the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu-restricted-extras">ubuntu-restricted-extras</a> package to enable these abilities.  Full terminal command is:<br />
<blockquote>
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras</blockquote>
It's easy enough to do, but annoying that this isn't included by default.  Still, it's a small price to pay to use free (as in speech) software.  Especially when it's also free (as in beer).
