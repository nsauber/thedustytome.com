I hate hate hate (did I say hate?) staring at black-on-white text on a monitor. When your whole day is spent in front of a computer, the glare from a bright LCD screen can lead to some pretty serious eye strain. So for any tool in which I spend a significant amount of time, I tend to adjust the colors to give my eyes a rest.<br />
<br />
As a developer working in an IDE with syntax highlighting, this can become a time-consuming process as you hunt down every last textual variant in the options. Fortunately, the kindly residents of the interwebs have contributed their time to the following websites.<br />
<br />
If you're a Microsoft corporate sellout, check out <a href="http://studiostyl.es/" target="_blank">Studio Styles</a>&nbsp;(for Visual Studio).<br />
<br />
If you're an Open Source&nbsp;hippie&nbsp;code-hugger, give <a href="http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse Color Themes</a> a click-through. There's also an Eclipse plug-in for easy in-editor switching. Nice!<br />
<br />
And for the love of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cheese%20and%20rice" target="_blank">Cheese and Rice</a>, turn down the brightness on those monitors! Your eyes will thank you!
