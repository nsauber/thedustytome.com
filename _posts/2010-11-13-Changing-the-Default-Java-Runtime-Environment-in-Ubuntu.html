<div>
I've been having trouble with a couple Java programs in Ubuntu, so I'm attempting to switch the Java Runtime Environment from the OpenJDK, which is default in Ubuntu, to the official Sun runtime.  I found <a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-install-sun-java-runtime-environment-jre-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx.html">instructions</a>, which I've followed with the following changes:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>the partner repository was added through the GUI Software Sources utility (System menu -&gt; Administration -&gt; Software Sources, or from the Ubuntu Software Center, Edit -&gt; Software Sources)</li>
<li>The sun-java6-jre and sun-java6-fonts packages were installed by searching in the "Canonical Partners" section of the Ubuntu Software Store.  The sun-java6-plugin package was not found and not installed.</li>
</ul>
<div>
Here's hoping things improve, and that there are no problems because of not installing the plugin package.</div>
