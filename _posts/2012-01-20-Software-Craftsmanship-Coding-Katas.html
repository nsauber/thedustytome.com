This is a collection of links to various coding katas I've run across. &nbsp;I haven't tried all of them, but probably will over time.<br />
<br />
For anyone wondering what the heck a kata is, <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/codekata/2007/01/code_katahow_it.html" target="_blank">this article</a> from Dave Thomas is a good place to start.<br />

First is Dave Thomas' post, which lists his original set of 21 kata.</div>

An interesting refactoring exercise where some files/classes in the project are absolutely off limits to editing. &nbsp;The link above references a C# starter solution, but you can find Java and Ruby starters&nbsp;<a href="http://craftsmanship.drupalgardens.com/content/gilded-rose-kata" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />

At&nbsp;<a href="http://codemash.org/" target="_blank">CodeMash</a>&nbsp;2012, there was a full-day session on "Putting the D&amp;D in TDD". &nbsp;I didn't attend, but got a link to a GitHub repo with the exercises from someone who did. &nbsp;Although not exactly a set of katas, it could still be an interesting set of exercises to go through.</div>
