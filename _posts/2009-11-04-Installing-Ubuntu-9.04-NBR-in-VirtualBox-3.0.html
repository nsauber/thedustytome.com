In preparation for setting up our soon-to-arrive (hopefully) new <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883103234&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-Desktop+PC-_-Acer+America-_-83103234">nettop</a> as a home theater PC, I'm experimenting with different media center programs and Linux/Ubuntu variations.  I think I've settled on using <a href="http://www.canonical.com/projects/ubuntu/unr">Ubuntu Netbook Remix</a> (NBR) as the base OS.  The large-icon interface seems like it would work well on a TV when viewed from a distance.  On top of this I'll install <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> (or maybe <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/homepage/">Boxee</a>) and the Linux version of the <a href="http://www.hulu.com/labs/hulu-desktop-linux">Hulu Desktop</a>.  I started with installing the fresh-out-of-the-oven Ubuntu 9.10 NBR, but found out that XBMC doesn't currently support <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/karmic/">Karmic</a> (they will when they release their next full version).  So for now I'm stuck with <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/jaunty/">Jaunty</a> if I want XBMC.<br />
<br />
The first challenge was finding the 9.04 downloads, since 9.10 just came out.  I eventually googled my way to <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/jaunty/">this page</a> which contains (at the bottom) links to all variety of 9.04 versions.  I grabbed the torrent file for the 9.04 Netbook Remix and queued it up in Transmission, Ubuntu's default BitTorrent client.<br />
<br />
The next challenge was being able to mount the downloaded .img file.  Why oh why didn't Canonical release an .iso?  I first tried converting the .img to a .iso using the <a href="http://www.mopedia.co.uk/2008/02/convert-img-to-iso-in-ubuntu.html">ccd2iso</a> console command (didn't work).  Then I found <a href="http://mdm-adph.blogspot.com/2009/05/using-img-files-with-virtualbox-to-test.html">this blog post</a>, which explains how to convert a .img to a VirtualBox hard drive file (.vdi) and mount the file as a second hard drive in VirtualBox.  The console command to convert is:<br />
<blockquote>
VBoxManage convertfromraw -format VDI [filename].img [filename].vdi</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
This worked like a charm.  I've now got a Jaunty NBR install in VirtualBox.  Next step is to install XBMC and Hulu Desktop to see how they play together.
