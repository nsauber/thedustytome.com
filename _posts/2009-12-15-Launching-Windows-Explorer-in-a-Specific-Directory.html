Here's something I've wanted to do for ages in Windows: starting Explorer in a specific directory from a shortcut.  The command-line is this:<br />
<blockquote>
C:\WINDOWS\explorer.exe /n,/e,c:\somepath</blockquote>
<br />
Note that the commas are necessary.  Refer to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/152457">this knowledge base article</a> for info on the commane-line switches.
