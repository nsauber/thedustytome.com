I had a whole post outlined with all the steps I went through to manually install [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) 3.0 in Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty, but decided to wait a couple days until 9.10 Karmic came out before finalizing my system setup.  As I hoped, it was a piece of cake in Karmic since VirtualBox 3.0 is now listed in the new Ubuntu Software Center!

I just launched the "Ubuntu Software Center" from the Applications menu.  When the Software Center opened, I typed "virtualbox" in the search bar in the upper-right corner.  "VirtualBox OSE" was listed.  (For reference, I later found it under the Accessories category in the Software Center.)  I double-clicked on it to get more info, and confirmed that it's a 3.0+ package (3.0.8 specifically), and clicked the Install button.  After entering my password, the Software Center downloaded and installed it without a hitch.  Now I can just run Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; VirtualBox OSE to launch.

No adding new repositories.  No terminal required.  It's almost too easy!  Good job, Cannonical.
