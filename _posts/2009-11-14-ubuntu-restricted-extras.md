After mucking around with [Amarok](http://amarok.kde.org/) for about half an hour, I remembered that by default, Ubuntu doesn't include support for "non-free" codecs like mp3 or dvd playback.  You have to install the [ubuntu-restricted-extras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu-restricted-extras) package to enable these abilities.  Full terminal command is:

{% highlight console %}
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
{% endhighlight %}

It's easy enough to do, but annoying that this isn't included by default. Still, it's a small price to pay to use free (as in speech) software.  Especially when it's also free (as in beer).
