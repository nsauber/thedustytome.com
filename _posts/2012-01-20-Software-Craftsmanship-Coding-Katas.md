This is a collection of links to various coding katas I've run across. I haven't tried all of them, but probably will over time. 
 
For anyone wondering what the heck a kata is, <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/codekata/2007/01/code_katahow_it.html" target="_blank">this article</a> from Dave Thomas is a good place to start. 

* [Dave Thomas' Original 21 Kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html) - First is Dave Thomas' post, which lists his original set of 21 kata.
* ["Vital Testing"](http://onestepback.org/vital_testing/) - A set of six Kata used during Jim Weirich's half-day session at [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/) 2012. 
* [NimblePros Kata](http://nimblepros.com/what-we-do/event-resources.aspx) - Ten kata, including bowling, fizzbuzz, greed, potter, and tennis scoring. 
* [Gilded Rose Kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/) - An interesting refactoring exercise where some files/classes in the project are absolutely off limits to editing. The link above references a C# starter solution, but you can find Java and Ruby starters [here](http://craftsmanship.drupalgardens.com/content/gilded-rose-kata).
* [EverCraft Kata](https://github.com/walterg2/evercraft-kata) - At [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/) 2012, there was a full-day session on "Putting the D&D in TDD". I didn't attend, but got a link to a GitHub repo with the exercises from someone who did. Although not exactly a set of katas, it could still be an interesting set of exercises to go through.
