I'm planning on using this blog primarily as a record for my own future reference: links/tools I find interesting, steps I took to accomplish an unfamiliar task, etc.  I'm sure it will evolve to include other things going forward.

A note about the name of the blog...

I wanted to capture the idea of a quest for knowledge and understanding.  Most other ideas I had were either either a little too esoteric, or were claimed by another Blogger user (even some of my favourite esoteric ones... bah!).  I thought this title might lend a little geek/gamer cred to the blog, while still leaving room for the occasional post with a bit of a philosophical bent.  I promise I'll try to remain coherent in my ramblings...

(try)...
