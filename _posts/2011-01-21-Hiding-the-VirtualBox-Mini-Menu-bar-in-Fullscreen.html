When you send a VirtualBox client into fullscreen mode [Host + F], there's a small 'Mini Menu' bar pinned to the bottom of the screen that has Devices and Machine menus on it.  This gets in the way, and although you can 'un-pin' it so it auto-hides, I keep bumping it in WinXP VMs when I'm mousing around the XP taskbar.  Fortunately, the interwebs is our friend, and a kind blogger <a href="http://artotech.wordpress.com/2010/12/23/moving-the-mini-menu-bar-in-fullscreen-virtualbox/">pointed out</a> that you can move the Mini Menu bar to the top of the screen:<br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your VM is not running</li>
<li>Open the Settings for that VM by right-clicking on it in the main VirtualBox GUI</li>
<li>Go to General -&gt; Advanced tab</li>
<li>Check the Mini Menu entry for 'Show at top of screen'</li>
</ol>
<div>
You can also turn the thing off entirely, if so desired.</div>
</div>
