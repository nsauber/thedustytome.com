To get set up for Android App development, I'm following the instructions from Google here:<br />
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html<br />
<br />
I installed Eclipse through the Ubuntu Software Center (searched for "eclipse" and clicked install).<br />
<br />
Also had to install eclipse-jdt (Java Development Tools) through the Synaptic Package Manager.<br />
Also had to install eclipse-pdt (Plugin Development Tools) through Package Manager.<br />
<div>
<i>(Edit 11/11/2010: When going through this process again with Ubuntu 10.4, I used the Ubuntu Software Center instead of the Synaptic Package Manager.  Also, I must have meant eclipse-pde - Plugin Development Environment, as I can't find eclipse-pdt listed as an available package.)</i><br />
<br />
Through Eclipses "Help -&gt; Install New Software" dialog, I had to add the basic software source for eclipse (don't know why this isn't set up by default) which is:<br />
http://download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo/<br />
and install "WST Server Adapters" which is apparently a prerequisite for the ADT plugin.  Learned that from this site: http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/1da899d34557f2e8?pli=1<br />
<br />
Now to try installing the android plugin (ADT) by adding:<br />
https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/<br />
to the eclipse list of software sources.<br />
<br />
Looks like that did it!  ADT is installed... (now what's next?)</div>
