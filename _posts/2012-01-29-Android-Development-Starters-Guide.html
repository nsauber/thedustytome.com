First things first, major appreciation goes out to Lars Vogel for his <a href="http://www.vogella.de/articles/Android/article.html" target="_blank">incredibly helpful tutorial</a> on Android development. &nbsp;The <a href="http://thedustytome.blogspot.com/2010/11/android-development-starters-guide.html" target="_blank">last time</a>&nbsp;I tinkered with all this, the best (only) online resources available were on the official <a href="http://developer.android.com/" target="_blank">Android Developers</a> site, which is a great reference site, but didn't provide the clearest guidance to get you up and running quickly. &nbsp;If you're here to get started with Android Development for the first time, save yourself some headaches and head straight over to Lars' tutorial. &nbsp;Thanks Lars!<br />

Second, the folks at Google have simplified the initial setup and installation process. &nbsp;No more mucking around to download and install the SDK, then install Eclipse and install the APK plug-in, then tell the APK where your SDK is... all these dependencies can be installed for you from inside Eclipse now, and that awkward SDK configuration is handled for you. &nbsp;So thanks Google!<br />
<br />
So, here are the steps I took to set up my Android development environment. &nbsp;FYI, I'm working in a VirtualBox VM with a sparkly fresh copy of Ubuntu 11.10.<br />
<ul>
<li>First, open the Ubuntu Software Center, search for "eclipse", and install the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment. &nbsp;(No need to install eclipse-jdt separately anymore, Ubuntu apparently gives it to you automatically now. &nbsp;Yay!) &nbsp;Note that it might take a while to download and install.</li>
<li>When it's done installing, launch Eclipse.</li>
<li>Use Eclipse's Update Manager (Help -&gt; Install New Software...) to&nbsp;install the Android Development Toolkit plug-in.</li>
<ul>
<li>First, be sure to add the software site for the version of Eclipse that you're using (in my case, it was&nbsp;<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo/">http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo/</a>). &nbsp;Otherwise Eclipse won't be able to resolve dependencies when installing the ADT plug-in. &nbsp;I don't know why this isn't added by default, but it always trips me up.</li>
<li>Next add Google's ADT software site (<a href="https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/">https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</a>).</li>
<li>Working with the Google software site, select the "Developer Tools" item and it's four sub-items.</li>
<li>Click Next, and after Eclipse did some calculating, click Next again to confirm that you want to install the items you selected.</li>
<li>Then accept a couple of license agreements, and click Finish.</li>
<li>Eclipse will popp up a progress dialog, and do its download and install magic.</li>
<ul>
<li>Note that in the middle of this step, I got a warning prompt asking me to confirm that I want to install unsigned content. &nbsp;Clicking "Details" revealed that it's Google's ADT components making Eclipse a little nervous. &nbsp;I clicked OK and didn't look back.</li>
</ul>
<li>When the installation completes, Eclipse should prompt me to restart (Eclipse, not the whole computer), which you should do.</li>
</ul>
<li>After Eclipse restarts, it should prompt you to configure a copy of the Android SDK that it can use.</li>
<ul>
<li>I opted to let it install a new copy of the Android SDK, and chose to install the "latest available version" (4.0.3 at the time I'm doing this). &nbsp;I left the default install location.</li>
<li>Clicking Next will lead to being prompted to let Google gather anonymous usage statistics on the SDK (your choice).</li>
<li>After a little bit of Eclipse progress-bar action, you should be prompted to Accept all of the SDK packages you wanted installed.</li>
<li>Then the Android SDK Manager will take over, showing a progress bar while it downloads and installs the SDK.</li>
<li>Note that only some of the SDK components are installed during this step. &nbsp;It's enough so you can write and release an app, but there are other components for each API version that you'll also want.</li>
</ul>
<li>In order to install ALL the components for a particular API version, you'll want to select them yourself in the Android SDK Manager.</li>
<ul>
<li>In Eclipse, Window -&gt; Android SDK Manager</li>
<li>Under the Packages section, check the box next to any entry or sub-entry that you want to install. &nbsp;I recommend just checking the box for each version of Android that you want to target, and let it auto-check all of it's sub-entries.</li>
<li>Then click Install, and wait...</li>
<li>...and wait...</li>
<li>...and maybe put on a TV show until it finishes downloading and installing.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
From here, I should be good to create a new android project. &nbsp;But that's for another day...<br />
