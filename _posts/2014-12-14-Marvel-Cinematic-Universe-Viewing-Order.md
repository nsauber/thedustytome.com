title:  "Marvel Cinematic Universe Viewing Order"

I've had a hard time finding a list of the Marvel movies, TV shows, and one-shots in release order (my baseline for preferred viewing)... so I'm making one myself. Note this is roughly release order, not chronological order. For simplicity when viewing, and since their placement doesn't really affect much, the "One Shot" short films are listed alongside the DVDs on which they were released.

Finally, I aim to keep this roughtly up-to-date as new films/shows are released, or as release dates are announced. So don't be surprised if this page changes on you.

_**Sources:** My main source was the [MCU Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe), but I also referenced [ShieldTV.net](http://shieldtv.net/marvel-cinematic-timeline-viewing-guide). Also, the [announcement](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/10/8010259/marvel-moves-release-dates-because-spider-man) of a Spider-Man film has affected parts of the phase 3 release schedule._
