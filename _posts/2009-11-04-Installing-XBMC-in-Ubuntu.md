Got XBMC installed in Ubuntu Jaunty NBR (inside VirtualBox). Instructions from the XMBC folks are [here](http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=HOW-TO_install_XBMC_for_Linux_on_Ubuntu_with_a_minimal_installation_step-by-step).

Performance inside VirtualBox is horrible. Hopefully it'll be much improved on the actual nettop. (It can't arrive soon enough).
