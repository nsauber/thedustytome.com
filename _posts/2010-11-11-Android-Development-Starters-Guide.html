I'm giving Android development another shot, and had to install Eclipse and the Android Development Tools again. Note that this is all on a box running Ubuntu 10.4.</div>
<div>

<div>
The <a href="http://developer.android.com/">Android Developers</a> site is a plethora of information, including setup instructions, a developer guide and reference, videos, tutorials, etc.  The following pages seem to be the most relevant when first getting started:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">SDK Download and Quick Start</a>, which includes a to-the-point SDK Quick Start guide</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html">Installing the SDK</a> is a more thorough version of the Quick Start guide, including next steps such as recommended reading and tutorials</li>
<li>A <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html">Hello, World</a> tutorial, the recommended first step for new developers</li>
<li>A <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/notepad/index.html">Notepad</a> tutorial, the recommended second step for new developers</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/index.html">Developer Resources</a> lists a few other tutorials that may be worth looking at</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
Here are the steps I took to prepare my development environment per the 'Installing the SDK' instructions:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>I followed (and updated) my old post on <a href="http://tomeofunderstanding.blogspot.com/2010/01/setting-up-eclipse-with-android.html">Setting up Eclipse and Android Development Tools in Ubuntu</a> to install the required Eclipse packages, and install the Android Development Tools plug-in for Eclipse.  This covers steps 1 &amp; 3 of the Quick Start / Installing the SDK guides.</li>
<li>For step 2 of the guides, installing the Android SDK, I downloaded the Linux platform SDK file from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">SDK download page</a> and unpacked it from the terminal with 'tar xzvf [filename]'.  I also added the SDK tools directory to my path, per instructions in the Installing the SDK guide.</li>
<li>For step 4 of the guides, I ran the GUI 'Android SDK and AVD Manager' by typing 'android' at the terminal (the 'android' executable is in the SDK 'tools' folder).  In the 'Available Packages' section, I installed everything.  At this time, it included the SDK Platform and Google API packages for Android versions 1.5 - 2.2, the Samples for SDK API 7 and 8 (Android 2.1 and 2.2), and the latest Documentation package.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
Note, I've let Eclipse use it's default '~/workspace/' path as my workspace, and I've unpacked the Android SDK into a folder under '~/dev/'.  Also, the "Android SDK and AVD Manager" can also be launched from within Eclipse by selecting "Window -&gt; Android SDK and AVD Manager".  You must first tell it where to find the SDK by going to "Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Android".</div>
<div>
<br /></div>

From here I was able to successfully complete the "<a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html">Hello, World</a>" tutorial. Good luck, and happy coding!</div>
