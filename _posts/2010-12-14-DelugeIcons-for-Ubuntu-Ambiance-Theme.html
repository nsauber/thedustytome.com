I prefer the Deluge bit-torrent client over Ubuntu's default of Transmission, but it's always been a minor annoyance that Deluge's icon in the notification area didn't match the mono-chromatic icons of Ubuntu's excellent Ambiance theme.  Fortunately, numbfall over at deviantart has <a href="http://numbfall.deviantart.com/art/Deluge-ubuntu-mono-dark-Icons-183740859">created a set of deluge icons</a> to compliment this theme.<br />
