Just upgraded to Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot, and found that Flash was no longer installed or working.  Fixed it by (re?)installing restricted extras, though I was surprised I had to do this since restricted extras was installed prior to the upgrade.  Oh well.

Also ran across this interesting post on "[10 things to do after installing Ubuntu 11.10](http://blog.sudobits.com/2011/09/08/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-11-10/)".  It's focused on a fresh install, and was written based on the 11.10 beta, but everything still applies and may be a helpful reference in the future.
