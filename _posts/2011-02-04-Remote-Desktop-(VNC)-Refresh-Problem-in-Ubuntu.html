I set up my main desktop computer to enable remote access to my desktop (System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Remote Desktop).  Then, when I access it from my laptop (Applications -&gt; Internet -&gt; Remote Desktop Viewer), I run into problems.  I am able to make a connection, and see the initial screen state when I first connect.  Any actions I take through remote desktop are visible on the desktop monitor, but my laptop's Remote Desktop Viewer doesn't get screen updates... it always looks as it did when I first connected.<br />

This is apparently a <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1383356">known</a> <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7168779">issue</a> with a workaround.  You just have to disable visual effects on the computer you're accessing (via System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Visual Effects -&gt; None).  This is definitely not ideal as it does clunkify and de-prettify Ubuntu a bit on the target system, but I can live with it for now as I'll be using the laptop far more often.
