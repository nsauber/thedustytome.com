This has been annoying me for ages. Here's the rather hidden means Facebook provides to block apps from sending notifications, etc.

1. In Facebook, click the world icon at the top of the page.
2. Click “see all notifications” at the bottom of the popup.
    * If you can’t find the world icon use this link to go to the notifications [directly](https://www.facebook.com/notifications).
3. Click on the X on the right side of the offending notification.
4. Click change app settings.
5. Select to notify NEVER.

These instructions were [blatently stolen](http://www.travolto.com/posts/how-to-block-hidden-chronicle-and-other-apps-on-facebook/) from the helpful Daniel Travolto.
